An automatic ping program that reports back saying how many successes or failures you have!
The set pings are for my server/workstations so you have to put your own pings for your own servers/workloads.

You can run this program while in the current directory:
`python servertest.py`

Don't have [Python 2?](https://www.python.org/downloads/source/)
